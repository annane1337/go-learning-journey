# Go Basics Example

This file contains a simple Go program that demonstrates basic concepts of the Go programming language. The code is designed to showcase different data types, variable declarations, constants, and concurrent programming using channels.

## Features

### 1. Data Types
- Demonstrates the use of various data types, including:
  - **Strings**
  - **Integers**
  - **Floats**
  - **Booleans**

### 2. Variable Declaration
- Shows different ways to declare and assign variables:
  - Using `var`
  - Using shorthand `:=`
  
### 3. Default Values
- Displays default values for uninitialized variables of different types.

### 4. Constants
- Explains the concept of constants and the immutability of their values.

### 5. Structs
- (Commented out) Illustrates how to define and use structs.

### 6. Channels
- Demonstrates the use of Go's goroutines and channels for concurrent programming.

## Getting Started

To run the program, ensure you have Go installed on your machine. Then, execute the following commands:

```bash
go run main.go
